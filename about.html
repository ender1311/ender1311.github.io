        <h1>About me</h1>

        <p> I am looking to transition into the tech industry. <br/><br/>
            I have a basic working knowledge of the following:<br/>
            <br/>
            Javascript<br/>
            HTML/CSS <br/>
            SQL <br/>
            React <br/>
            Python <br/>
            
        </p>
        <br/><br/><br/>
        <h2>My Story</h2>
        <p>I grew up with computers and video games.<br/>
          I built my first computer and my first website at 15.<br/>
          I learned C++ at 16.<br/>
          
          Video games inspired me with stories and connection between characters. 
          Sadly, I realized I did not have those in reality. 
          In a world where I was isolated from peers, computers offered a way for me to use my skills but didnâ€™t fulfill the ache for friendships.<br/>
          <br/>
          In college, I discovered the incredible, transformative impact of a community that simply loved and valued me. 
          I made many close friendships. 
          At my wedding, I expanded my group of six groomsmen to include thirty mighty men.<br/>
          <br/>
          That transformation in college was so profound that I spent the next 15 years working for churches/ non-profits in order to see that incredible transformation work in others.<br/>
          <br/>
          Recently, I have decided to transition into the tech industry in order to combine my passion for technology with the determination to help people feel valued as human beings.<br/>
          <br/>
          I believe that tech can be leveraged for many positive things: quality of life, human connection, time spent with family and friends, and access to goods/services.<br/>
