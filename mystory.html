                <h2 class="fade-in">I witnessed the proliferation of the internet growing up...</h2>
                <p>
                  I built my first computer and my first website at 15<br/>
                  
                  
                </p>
                <p>Video games 
                <span class="highlight_inspired">inspired </span> me
                with stories of great friendships
                
                  <p>
                    I discovered that making friends was not always easy in reality
                  </p>
                  
                 
                  <p>
                    In college I found a group of friends that simply loved and <span class="highlight_value">valued</span> me
                    
                    </p>
                   <p>
                    This changed my life
                   </p> 

                   <p>
                    I spent the next 15 years working for churches/ non-profits
                  </p>
                  
                             
                  <p>
                    My aim was to see that incredible transformation work in others
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    I <span class="highlight_grew">mentored </span> dozens of next-generation leaders every year
                    </p>
                    
                    <p>
                    Recently, I decided to transition my career and pivot back to my love of tech
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    In order to combine my <span class="highlight_inspired">passion</span> for technology 
                    
                    </p>
                    <p>and my determination to bring value to as many<span class="highlight_value"> humans</span> as possible</p>
                  
                  
                  <p>
                    Coding is just so interesting to me!  
                  </p>
                    <p>
                    I am constantly trying to solve problems with tech
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    My list of things I want to learn how to do just keeps <span class="highlight_grew">growing</span>
                  </p>
                    <p>
                    Tech brings out the unending <span class="highlight_inspired">curious</span> nature in me!
                  </p>

                    <p>
                    I believe that tech can be leveraged for many positive things including: education, quality of life, and human connection.
