                <h1>My Story</h1>
                <h2>I witnessed the proliferation of the internet...</h2>
                <p>
                  I built my first computer and my first website at 15.<br/>
                  I learned C++ at 16.
                  
                </p>
                <p>Video games 
                <span class="highlight_inspired">inspired me</span> 
                with stories and connection between characters. <br>
                  Sadly, I realized I did not have those in reality. <br>
                  In a world where I was <span class="highlight_ache">isolated</span> from peers, computers offered me a way to connect.
                  
                </p>  
                  <p>
                    In college, I discovered the incredible, transformative impact of a community that simply loved and <span class="highlight_value">valued me</span>. <br>
                  I made many close friendships. <br>
                  At my wedding, I expanded my group of six groomsmen to include thirty mighty men.

                  </p>                
                  <p>
                    That transformation in college was so profound that I spent the next 15 years working for churches/ non-profits.<br>
                    My aim was to see that incredible transformation work in others.<br/>
                    I <span class="highlight_grew">mentored </span> dozens of next-generation leaders every year.<br>
                    </p>
                    
                    <p>
                    Recently, I have decided to transition into the tech industry<br>
                    This gives me the opportunity to combine my <span class="highlight_inspired">passion</span> for technology with my determination to bring value to as many<span class="highlight_value"> humans</span> as possible<br/>
                    <br/>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Coding is just so interesting to me!<br>
                    I constantly run into problems that can be solved with tech.<br> 
                    I am always trying to think of ways to automate my life.<br> 
                    </p>

                    <p>
                    Tech brings out the unending <span class="highlight_inspired">curious</span> nature in me!<br>
                    I believe that tech can be leveraged for many positive things: quality of life, human connection, and time spent with family and friends.
